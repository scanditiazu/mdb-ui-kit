## Step 1: Download the Installer
  
The first step is to download the installer for Aerosoft Airbus X Extended from the official website of Just Flight. You will need to log in with your account and enter your serial number to access the download link. The installer is about 1.8 GB in size, so make sure you have enough space on your hard drive.
  
## Step 2: Run the Installer
  
The next step is to run the installer as an administrator. You can do this by right-clicking on the installer file and selecting "Run as administrator". The installer will ask you to select your language and accept the terms and conditions. Then, it will ask you to select the destination folder for the installation. You can choose any folder you want, but it is recommended to install it in a separate folder outside of your main FSX or P3D folder. This will make it easier to manage and update your add-on later.
  
The installer will also ask you to select which simulator you want to install the add-on for: FSX or P3D. You can install it for both if you have both simulators installed, but you will need to run the installer twice and select a different destination folder each time. The installer will then copy the files and folders to your selected destination folder.
  
## Step 3: Activate the Add-on
  
The final step is to activate the add-on in your simulator. To do this, you need to run your simulator as an administrator and select Aerosoft Airbus X Extended from the aircraft selection menu. The first time you load the add-on, it will ask you to enter your serial number again. You can find your serial number in your Just Flight account or in the confirmation email you received when you purchased the add-on. After entering your serial number, click on "Activate" and wait for a few seconds. The add-on should be activated and ready to use.
  
## Troubleshooting Tips
  
If you encounter any problems with installing or running Aerosoft Airbus X Extended, here are some tips that may help:

- Make sure you have the latest version of FSX or P3D installed. You can check for updates from within your simulator or from the official websites of Microsoft or Lockheed Martin.
- Make sure you have the latest version of Aerosoft Airbus X Extended installed. You can check for updates using the Aerosoft Updater tool that comes with the add-on. The updater tool will scan your installation folder and download any available updates automatically.
- If you have other add-ons installed that may conflict with Aerosoft Airbus X Extended, such as other aircraft or scenery, try disabling them temporarily and see if that solves the issue. You can disable add-ons by renaming or moving their folders outside of your main FSX or P3D folder.
- If you have any antivirus or firewall software running on your computer, try adding an exception for Aerosoft Airbus X Extended and its installer. Some antivirus or firewall software may block or interfere with the installation or activation process.
- If none of the above tips work, you can contact Just Flight's customer support or Aerosoft's community forum for further assistance. They may be able to provide more specific solutions or instructions for your case.
